38729,Josh Groban,Weeping,"(Feat. Ladysmith Black Mambazo)      I knew a man who lived in fear   It was huge, it was angry,   It was drawing near.   Behind his house a secret place   Was the shadow of the demon   He could never face.      He built a wall of steel and flame   And men with guns to keep it tame   Then standing back he made it plain   That the nightmare would never ever rise again   But the fear and the fire and the guns remain.      It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow   He tells the world that it's sleeping   But as the night came round I heard   It's lonely sound   It wasn't roaring, it was weeping   It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.      And then one day the neighbors came   They were curious to know about the smoke and flame   They stood around outside the wall   But of course there was nothing to be heard at all   ""My friends,"" he said, ""We've reached our goal   The threat is under firm control   As long as peace and order reign   I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain   Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain. ""      It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow   He tells the world that it's sleeping   But as the night came round I heard   It's lonely sound   It wasn't roaring, it was weeping   It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.

25786,Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,"Sixteen years,   Sixteen banners united over the field   Where the good shepherd grieves.   Desperate men, desperate women divided,   Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.      Fortune calls.   I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,   Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.   She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,   On midsummer's eve, near the tower.      The cold-blooded moon.   The captain waits above the celebration   Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid   Whose ebony face is beyond communication.   The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.      They shaved her head.   She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.   A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.   I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,   Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.      I stumbled to my feet.   I rode past destruction in the ditches   With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.   Renegade priests and treacherous young witches   Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.      The palace of mirrors   Where dog soldiers are reflected,   The endless road and the wailing of chimes,   The empty rooms where her memory is protected,   Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.      She wakes him up   Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking   Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.   She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.   He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.      Gentlemen, he said,   I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,   I've moved your mountains and marked your cards   But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination   Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.      Peace will come   With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire   But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall   And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating   Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

53460,Tom Lehrer,National Brotherhood Week,"One week of every year is designated National Brotherhood Week. This is just one of many such weeks honoring various worthy causes. One of my favorites is National Make-fun-of-the-handicapped Week which Frank Fontaine and Jerry Lewis are in charge of as you know. During National Brotherhood Week various special events are arranged to drive home the message of brotherhood. This year, for example, on the first day of the week Malcolm X was killed which gives you an idea of how effective the whole thing is. I'm sure we all agree that we ought to love one another and I know there are people in the world that do not love their fellow human beings and I hate people like that. Here's a song about National Brotherhood Week.      Oh, the white folks hate the black folks,   And the black folks hate the white folks.   To hate all but the right folks   Is an old established rule.      But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,   Lena Horne and Sheriff Clarke are dancing cheek to cheek.   It's fun to eulogize   The people you despise,   As long as you don't let 'em in your school.      Oh, the poor folks hate the rich folks,   And the rich folks hate the poor folks.   All of my folks hate all of your folks,   It's American as apple pie.      But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,   New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans 'cause it's very chic.   Step up and shake the hand   Of someone you can't stand.   You can tolerate him if you try.      Oh, the Protestants hate the Catholics,   And the Catholics hate the Protestants,   And the Hindus hate the Moslems,   And everybody hates the Jews.      But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,   It's National Everyone-smile-at-one-another-hood Week.   Be nice to people who   Are inferior to you.

54780,Van Der Graaf Generator,Childlike Faith In Childhood's End,"Existence is a stage on which we pass   a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart:   it's hopeless, I know,   but onward I must go   and try to make a start   at seeing something more than day to day   survival, chased by final death   if I believed this the sum   of the life to which we've come,   I wouldn't waste my breath   Somehow, there must be more. There was a time   when more was felt than known   but now, entrenched inside my sett,   in light more mundane,   thought rattles round my brain:   we live, we die...and yet?      In the beginning there was order and destiny   but now that path has reached the border,   and on our knees   is no way to face the future, whatever it be.   Though the forces which hold us in place   last through eons in unruffled grace   we, too, wear the face of creation.      As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically   the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead,   all space is living history.   It seems as though time must betray us,   yet we're alive   and though I see no God to save us,   yetl we survive   through the centuries of progress   which don't get us very far.   All illusion! All is bogus -   we don't yet know what we are...   Laughing, hoping, praying, joking, Son of Man!   with lowered eyes but lifting hearts,   we're grains of sand   and though, in time, the sea   may claim us for its own   we are the rocks which root the future -   on us it grows!      We might not be there to share it   if eternity's a jest   but I think that I can bear it   if the next life is the best.   Even if there is a heaven when we die,   endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie   that always comes as answer to the question,   ""Why do we see through the eyes of creation?""      Adrift without a course,   it's very lonely here,   our only conjecture   what lies behind the dark.   Still, I find I can cling to a lifeline,   think of a lifetime which means more   than my own one -   dreams of a grander thing than we are.   Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders:   when all life is over who can say   no mutated force shall remain?   Though the towers of the city are denied   to we men of clay   still we know we shall scale   the heights some day.   Frightened in the silence -   frightened, but thinking very hard,   let us make computations of the stars.      Older, wiser, sadder, blinder, watch us run:   faster, longer, harder, stronger, now it comes:   colour blisters, image splinters gravitate   towards the centre, in final splendour disintegrate,   The universe now beckons   and Man, too, must take His place...   just a few last fleeting seconds   to wander in the waste,   and the children who were ourselves move on,   reincarnation stills its now perfected song,   and at last we are free of the bonds of creation.      All the jokers and gaolers, all the junkies   and slavers too,   all the throng who have danced a merry tune -   human we can all be,   but Humanity we must rise above,   in the name of all faith and hope and love.   There's a time for all pilgrims,   and a time for the fakers too,   there's a time when we all will stand alone   and nude,   naked to the galaxies -   naked, but clothed in the overview...   as we reach Childhood's End we must start anew.      And though dark is the highway,   and the peak's distance breaks my heart,   for I never shall see it, still I play my part,   believing that what waits for us   is the cosmos compared to the dust of the past...   In the death of mere humans life shall start  ",FALSE

""Say hi to Earl and Edith.   Tell 'm I'm doing fine.   Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now,   They should cut the line.""      ""Can grandma come and see me?

They came through the gate and across the lawn   Knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch.   And grandpa saw them there,   Looking through the venetian blind.   ""Those people don't have any respect,   So they won't get any of mine.""      ""I don't wanna talk about Jed.   I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9.

He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet,   Loaded up both barrels.   Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off,   And up walked a woman named Carol.      ""Susan Carol from Early Magazine,   I got some questions to ask.""   ""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine!""   Grandpa said with a gasp.      Then he fell face first and let out a sigh,   And Edith ran out in shock.   He was looking at her from down on the floor,   Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk.      ""That guy just keeps singin'!   Can somebody shut him up?   I don't know for the life of me   Where he comes up with that stuff.""      They laid his head on a newspaper   With a picture of Carmichael on the front page,   Posing with the little league baseball team,   And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle.

Forget the whale -   We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""   ""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,   Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.      ""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.   I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.

I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""   Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -   Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.      I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank   To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.   They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.   They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France   Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend   Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.      I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.

I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,   But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was   I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.   He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""   I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,   When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.   A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -   When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!      Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab   At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.   I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,   Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.   So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.   It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.      Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.   I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.   They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".   They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.   I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""   They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.      Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale   That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,   But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -   I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.

But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin   That's when LL come in   Blast a ass like Apollo 13   Sugar get the cream   Hoppin' dom in every direction   What a scene   He can't understand your best friend's plan   Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man   Good love, have fun, tight hugs and flowers   I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers   Better get down before ya cryin' at home   I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone   Some brother's won't appreciate that   Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack?
