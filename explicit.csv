People on the street,   They panic and start running.   Words on loose leaf,   Sheet complete coming.   I jump on my mind,   I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.   Healing the blind,   I promise to let the sun in.   Sick of the dark ways,   We march to the drumming.   Jump when they tell us   They want to see jumping.   Fuck that, I want to   See some fist pumping.   Risk something.

Have to react,   Or get blown into fractions.   Ten years old is something to see,   Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,   Taken and bound and found later under a tree,   I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me"".   Do you see?   The soldiers they're out today.   That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.   It's ironic,   At times like this you pray,   But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.

Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.   Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.   Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.   I know.
